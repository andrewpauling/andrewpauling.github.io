I am a graduate student in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle, WA. My research focusses on the interaction between Antarctica and the global climate system. Currently I am working on the effect of Antarctic topography change on climate with Professor Cecilia Bitz and Professor Eric Steig.

Below is an animation of surface temperature in a dry atmosphere model "spinning up" from rest that I made for a climate modelling class.
