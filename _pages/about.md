I am a graduate student in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle, WA. My research focusses on the interactions between polar regions and the global climate system. I have worked on a wide range of projects in this area including the influence of meltwater fluxes from Antarctic ice shelves on trends in Antarctic sea ice extent, the effects of Antarctic topography change on climate, the effect of surface flooding of Arctic sea ice on its future evolution, and the impact of large volcanic eruptions on sea ice in both hemispheres. In all my work I make use of a hierarchy of models, ranging from simple energy balance models to state-of-the-art global climate models. I am also passionate about the use of open-source software in science, and have contributed to the xarray project and given numerous tutorials on using Python for Earth Science.

Below is an animation of surface temperature in a dry atmosphere model "spinning up" from rest that I made for a climate modelling class.
