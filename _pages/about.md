I am a research fellow in the Department of Physics at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand working with Dr Inga Smith. I am working on simulations of the effect of increased meltwater from Antarctica on Antarctic sea ice, the Southern Ocean, and global climate in the New Zealand Earth System Model (NZESM). This work is funded by the Deep South Challenge, one of New Zealand's National Science Challenges.

In October 2025 I will join the Antarctic Research Centre at Victoria University of Wellington working on sea ice model coupling as part of the "Antarctic Sea Ice Switch" project. 

I previously completed my PhD working with Professor Cecilia Bitz in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle, WA. My graduate work was supported by a Fulbright New Zealand Science and Innovation Award, a UW Program on Climate Change Graduate Fellowship, as well as research grants from NSF and NOAA. My research focused on the interactions between polar regions and the global climate system. I have worked on a wide range of projects in this area including the influence of meltwater fluxes from Antarctic ice shelves on trends in Antarctic sea ice extent, the effects of Antarctic topography change on climate, the effect of surface flooding of Arctic sea ice on its future evolution, and the impact of large volcanic eruptions on climate and sea ice. In all my work I make use of a hierarchy of models of the climate system, ranging from simple energy balance models to state-of-the-art global climate models. I am also passionate about the use of open-source software in science, and have contributed to the xarray project and given numerous tutorials on using Python for Earth Science.

Below is an animation of surface temperature in a dry atmosphere model "spinning up" from rest that I made for a climate modelling class.
